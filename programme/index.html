<h2>Schedule</h2>

<p>The schedule has been published, view it <a href="/schedule">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Call For Participation</h2>

<h3>Call for Lunchtime Events</h3>

<p>Due to the constantly growing number of delegates, this year we
have a two hour lunch break and each delegate is assigned a 30 min
slot to be in the restaurant. To make good use of the other hour and a
half, we have asked you, the PyCon UK community, to organise events in
the track rooms.</p>

<p>These need to be informal events that can handle people dropping in
and out. Examples may include 'birds of a feather' sessions, discussions,
special interest groups, demonstrations/install-fests/helpdesks for
particular software libraries etc.</p>

<p>It is allowed and encouraged for generally applicable lunchtime
events to be held twice i.e. 12pm on one day, 1pm on another (for
example, see the code clinic in the schedule) or across a whole two
hour slot (for example, see the poster session in the schedule).</p>

<p>To submit a proposal for a lunchtime event, please scroll down to the
form below.</p>

<h3>Still Open - Poster Session at PyCon UK</h3>

<p>
This year we will be adding a poster session to PyCon UK. Poster sessions are great chances to present a topic with the aid of a poster, and to interact with small groups of people in a more informal and relaxed way than a formal talk.
</p>

<p>Posters will be accepted for the poster session on a rolling basis until 1 August or the limit of 20 posters is reached. And yes, talk proposals which are not accepted can be reworked and submitted as posters.
</p>

<p><b>For more information about the poster session</b>, visit the <a href="/posters/">poster session page</a>.

<p><b>Please note</b> that speakers, workshop leaders, and poster presenters are expected to buy tickets,
and that we are not able to provide financial assistance to speakers this
year.</p>

<p>So, if you'd like to submit a proposal for a poster or lunchtime
event please fill out the form below.</p>
