### Samantha Ahern

A number of robotics platforms can be used for education, these include the Lego Mindstorms robots the NXT and EV3 and the Vex. Additionally, mobile robots can be constructed from kits such as the BoE robotics Shield kit for Arduino and have Raspberry Pi or Arduino controllers.  In addition to the Lego porgramming interface the Lego robots can be programmed with various C based languages e.g. NXC and RobotC, whilst the Vex can be programmed with C based languages and Python. The aim of this session is to discuss my adventures in moving from NXC to Python for programming mobile robots.  My experience is in programming a Lego NXT with NXC and RobotC.  A mobile robot will be constructed and programmed using Python.  In the session I will compare and contrast the programmes created for both the Lego NXT in NXC and the new Python programmed robot, discuss lessons learned, ease of understanding of the programming language and demo both robots.
