### Katie Barr

I will introduce how image recognition, also known as template matching, works, using convolution. In particular I will described the algorithms used by Open CV, and tell the audience how to implement their own in Python. 

Whilst the algorithms are very simple, and intuitively understood, if you do not take care when implementing them you can end up with extremely inefficient computations.

We will see how adjusting parameters in your algorithm can lead to very impressive results- the demo showing a range of letters, with different antialising, on different tiled backgrounds. By choosing appropriate parameters for your template recognition, you can find matches with apparently large differences to the template.
