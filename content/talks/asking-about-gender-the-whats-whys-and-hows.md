### Claire Gowler

As we move towards more customised experiences for our users, why do we still insist of using the black boxes of male and female when asking users about their gender? And why are we asking for it in the first place?

Between 1 and 5 percent of the UK population identifies as having a non-binary gender or are transgender. This talk aims to help developers ask users about their gender in a useful and sensitive manner; educate on what non-binary means and what other issues non-binary and gender variant users may face when using the web.
