### Irina Bolychevsky

A device in every pocket, a browser in every home and the internet of things that may spy on you or connect you. The digital revolution has left us ever more dependant on an increasingly centralised net, large parts of which are controlled by fewer and fewer institutions. 

Irina of http://redecentralize.org will be exploring some of the implications of centralisation, the projects working to change this, the possibilities decentralisation creates and what we could do next. 
Come along, say hello, voice your thoughts and get involved!
