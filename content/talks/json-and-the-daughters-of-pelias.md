### Zeth

The JSON Data Interchange Format is Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF) standard RFC-7159. Since its release, many new draft internet
standards have been published including JSON Schema
(draft-zyp-json-schema-04), JSOND (draft-oskarsson-jsond-00), JSON
Pointer (RFC-6901), JSON-LD (W3C Recommendation), JSON Merge Patch
(RFC-7386), JSON-RPC and JSON Reference
(draft-pbryan-zyp-json-ref-03); while new Python object to JSON
serialisation techniques have been published such as jsonpickle.

In this session we will implement these JSON technologies using Python
and evaluate their individual usefulness but also discuss how these
proposals can and cannot be combined to make JSON powered Python
applications. Finally, we will look at a Python application that I
made using some of these technologies.
