### Tapasweni Pathak

The Python Package Index (PyPI) is a repository of software for the Python programming language. There are currently 58K+ packages there. There are so many different types of packages, fullfilling different needs. The package pushed on PyPI is very easy to use and help developers to get their stuff done easily.

This talk will talk about best practices while adding your package to PyPI. In this I’ll talk about why it is important to push your code to Test PyPI first. I’ll also talk about why it is important to push your package to PyPI so that everyone can use your code easily.

From this talk I want to convey how with your some lines of code pushed to PyPI, you can help people to reuse your code and get their work done easily.
