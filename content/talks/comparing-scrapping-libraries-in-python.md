### Tapasweni Pathak

Let's review some of the Python scraping libraries. Let's compare them in terms of speed, accuracy, strength, usability. We will review

BeautifulSoup
Scrapy
I will compare them with a series of sites evaluating how quickly they can parse pages and how accurately they can find data.

I will also share the tips and tricks of how we can increase their power by using some tools we have already, like selenium.
