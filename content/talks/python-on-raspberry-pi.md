### Ben Nuttall

Python is the most popular language in the Raspberry Pi
community. Also with the Raspberry Pi, it's easy to do physical
computing directly from Python code - rather than usual embedded
hardware engineering in C or Assembler.

In this talk Iâ€™ll show examples of computing projects that use Python
on the Raspberry Pi and demonstrate the sort of code used in such
projects.

This will be an informative session with learning possibilities to
give those new to Python on the Raspberry Pi a chance to get started.

Ben Nuttall is the Education Developer Advocate at the Raspberry Pi
Foundation in Cambridge, UK.
