### Tim Golden

I've set up a short series of workshops to help a small group of 13-15-year-old boys to learn how to code with a small element of physical computing thrown in. This talk will describe the reasons for the setup and approach I used, and will discuss the outcomes: what worked; what didn't; and what I might do differently.
