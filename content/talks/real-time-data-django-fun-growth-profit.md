I've been trying for 2 years to find a good [*] solution for how to add real-time wow into my ebook search site Luzme. Finally, I think I may have it; 

Python/Django meets AngularJS/Firebase; and Luzme finally gets real-time data updates without thrashing the database with repeated querying.

[*] "Good" = easy to implement + scalable + financially viable
