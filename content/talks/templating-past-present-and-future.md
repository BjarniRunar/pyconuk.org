### Ed Singleton

A summary of templating, with a look at older templating systems that have fallen by the wayside, the current choices for templating, and what the future of templating might be like, including what other languages are doing and whether we can learn anything from them.

There will naturally be bit of a focus on web programming, though we will definitely be looking at other uses of templating.

There will be some analysis of different styles of templating, looking at brevity, readability and power.

If anyone wants a templating system to be discussed, do feel free to let me know ahead of time.
