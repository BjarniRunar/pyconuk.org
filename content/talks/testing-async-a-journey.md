### James Broadhead

Testing asynchronous code can require different approaches to writing tests, and learning to write good tests can inform the architecture of your codebase. 
This talk will describe the evolution of testing in the TweetDeck API, a Twisted Python web api, and discuss some approaches to extending test coverage over a large legacy codebase. 
Examples will be in Twisted, but will be intended to be relevant to anyone working with established codebases or working with async in particular.
