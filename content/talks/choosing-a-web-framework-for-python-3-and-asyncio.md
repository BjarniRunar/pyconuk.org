### Dan Clark

I left PyconUK 2014 with a feeling that I couldn't look myself in the mirror for too much longer without upgrading at least one of my projects to python 3. Yet I was happy with my flask+gevent+websockets stack and the lack of a clear migration path to python 3 was putting me off.

In this talk, I'll cover some of the challenges that came with selecting aiohttp, a relatively young/small/clean framework built on asyncio, like login and user registration, things we take for granted when using a more mature framework like django, flask or pyramid.
