[Gabbi](http://cdent.github.io/gabbi/) is a Python-based tool for
testing web APIs using an easy to write and read YAML format that allows
tests to focus on HTTP requests and responses, not Python. It was
developed to make it easier to learn and contribute to OpenStack APIs
but can be used in any environment, even for testing services that don't
use Python (if that's your thing).

The presentation will give an overview of why Gabbi exists and a live
demonstration of its features. Listeners will hopefully go home with a
new and useful tool and an expanded perspective on ways to make tests
for web APIs.

For a taste of what the presentation will provide see
[these slides](http://redhat.slides.com/chdent/gabbi?token=EE3TApJU)
which were used to give a similar talk at the OpenStack Liberty Summit.
This talk will be an updated version including new features and learnings
from use in the field.
