### Stefan Popa

Scripting languages such as PHP or Python have a crucial role in powering most of todayâ€™s Web or Cloud-based applications running in Datacenters worldwide. In order to maintain competitive advantage, the performance of Python language must be under constant scrutiny so that the best results are obtained. Enabling open source contributors to focus on the performance status of the contributed code can be achieved by automating some of the repetitive tasks. This presentation proposes a framework which aims to facilitate the monitoring process by automatically measuring the selected relevant benchmarks for the Python code base.
