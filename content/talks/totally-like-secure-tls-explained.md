### Cory Benfield

TLS (a.k.a. The Artist Formerly Known As SSL, a.k.a. Ƭ̵̬̊) is the security technology that developers are most likely to work with closely on a regular basis. It’s also probably the most important security technology in the world. More importantly, it’s the most frequently incorrectly implemented security technology in the world.

This talk will give you the grounding you need to understand what TLS is, and some of how it works. Most importantly though, this talk will give you concrete advice on how to work with TLS to avoid making mistakes in your own code and exposing yourself to risk.
