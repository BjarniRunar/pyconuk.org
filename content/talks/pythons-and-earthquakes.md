### Girish Kumar

This is a session we will cover how python is used in providing near-real-time maps of landslide hazard following large earthquakes. And to dig detail on tool we build called 'shakeslide' for post-distaster response, analysis and research. 

By end of this session my audience will be enriched by the potential of python programming language and its contribution in the solving some of the serious issues in today's world, in field of research. I will also discuss the process of  how research paper was converted into functional web application and its impact of doing that. Hopefully, this talk should motivate PhD students and research staff in using python for their projects and helps them to realise their potential impact they could make in their research application.
