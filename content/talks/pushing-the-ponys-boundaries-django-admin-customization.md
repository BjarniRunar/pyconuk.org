### Ola Sitarska

Django Admin was a single reason that made me switch from PHP to Python in a day. That was 6 years ago, but I still believe that the Admin is Django's most important feature. If you ever wondered how Django Admin works and want to take a peek behind the curtains, this is a talk for you. You'll learn the magic tricks to make Django Admin more user friendly, and we will also talk a little bit about what the future holds for it.
