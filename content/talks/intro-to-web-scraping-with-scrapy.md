### Muhammad Yasoob Ullah Khalid

Suppose you want to extract data from a website. What do you do? You use their API but what if that website does not have an API? That is where web scraping comes into play. In this talk I would discuss the basics of web scraping. We would be using Scrapy. It is a very famous and well respected scraping framework written in Python. 

I would also discuss some basic questions which every beginner asks like how to extract data from a website which uses JavaScript and how to circumvent rate limiting. 

This talk is aimed at beginners and intermediate Python programmers. If you fall into that category then don't hesitate to check us out at the conference.
