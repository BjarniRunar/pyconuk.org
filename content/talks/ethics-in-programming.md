### Nicholas Tollervey

Ethics (or moral philosophy) addresses questions such as "how should I live?", "what is a good life?" and "how do I tell right from wrong?".

This talk will provide an quick overview of the philosophical discipline of ethics and dive into several examples of applied ethics within the context of programming. I'll give pointers to philosophical traditions and provide a context for further exploration and reflection on the part of the listener.

I'll finish by describing how ethics and philosophical reflection affects my own practice as a programmer.
