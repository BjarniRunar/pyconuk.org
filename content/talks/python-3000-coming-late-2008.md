### Daniel Pope

"Python 3.0 final was released on December 3rd, 2008."

Python 3 is a better language than Python 2.

In 2015, many people still start new projects in Python 2. Many people, if asked just to run Python, will start Python 2. Of course, many of us are shackled to Python 2 for work, but there's no excuse for new Py2-only or Py2-first projects on our own time.

Daniel will encourage people to change their default thinking from Python 2 to Python 3; to see Python 2 as pass√©; and to take the next small step to move to Python 3.
