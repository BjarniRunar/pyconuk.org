### Helen Sherwood-Taylor

Mocking is a valuable technique for writing tests, but is it always a good idea?

I want to give a brief introduction to the how and why of mocking and the scope of its usefulness - I'll look at situations where it is provides the most benefit and the times when it can be taken too far. 

Python is packaged with an excellent mocking module but we'll also look at some other libraries which can help with mocking effectively.
