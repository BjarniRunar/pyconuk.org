### Santiago Basulto

A soft talk dealing with the most iportant traits related to become a good programmer. I'm a programmer with more than 10 years of experience and during this time I've learnt to recognize the good traits that make good programmers. This talk will start from the basics and move over more advanced topics. We'll also see examples of good python code. It's loosly related to this talk: "Transforming Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0go).
