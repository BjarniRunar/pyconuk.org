### Tina Zhang

This talk is an introduction to the world of cryptography, with a quick overview of how to use a Python wrapper for the Gnu Privacy Guard to encrypt documents/emails.  

For anyone who is interested in meeting other pythonistas/wannabe-secret-agents at an encryption key signing party, I will try to organise an open-space/corridor event for this also.
