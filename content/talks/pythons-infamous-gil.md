### Larry Hastings

You’ve heard about Python’s GIL. But what is it really? What does it do, both good and bad?

Come learn all about the Python GIL. You’ll learn about its history, all the problems it solves, all the problems it causes (that we know about!), and what it would take to remove the GIL.

Attendees should be familiar with the terrors inherent in multithreaded programming, and be comfortable with a little C code in the slides.
