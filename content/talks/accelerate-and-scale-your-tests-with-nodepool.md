### Yolanda Robla Mota

I will describe Nodepool, the Openstack Infra tool used to spin up virtual machines for testing,
according to the realtime demand for tests.

I will explain how to setup it, and how to integrate with Gearman and Jenkins, to allow to run
tests on real-time and scaling that automatically.
