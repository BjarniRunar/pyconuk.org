### JÃ¸rn Lomax

The talk will demonstrate how to port python2 code to python 3, either to make it exclusive to python3, or to make it cross compatible. This will be demonstrated using the python-future package. There will be demonstrations for both small and large projects. After this talk, you should be able to handle porting any python code to be compatible with any version of python >= 2.6

This talk is based on work done during summer where the buildbot project was ported from python2, to be cross compatible with python3. The talk will look at how this was done and some of the important lessons learned in the process.
