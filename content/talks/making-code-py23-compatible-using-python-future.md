### JÃ¸rn Lomax

The talk will demonstrate how to port a Python2 project to python3 using python-future. If you have ever ported a project from python2 to python3 and thought it was a pain. Or maybe you have a python2 only project you would like to update. Then this talk is for you!

The talk will focus on how to enable easy porting using the compatibility library "python-future" and how it can help ensure your project will work with any version of python. It will also give a very simple overview of the considerations that have to be taken into account when porting your project. It will also look briefly at back-porting python3 code to work with python2
