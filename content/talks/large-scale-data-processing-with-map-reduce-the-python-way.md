### Vishal Kanaujia

Modern businesses such as e-commerce analyze huge data sets to derive business trends and patterns. Hadoop is the most popular choice to store large data in its HDFS file system. It introduced Map Reduce programming to process data and uses distributed and highly scalable data crunching applications.

Python provides an array of tools to handle different stages of data analysis. Data analysis involves following stages:

Data Preprocessing (Pandas)
Data Analysis (scikit-learn, nltk)
Data Pipeline (MRjob, Hadoop Streaming)
Data Visualization (matplotlib)

In this talk, we would discuss 'Data Pipeline' stage and its Python modules to develop Map-Reduce applications that work seamlessly on a Hadoop cluster. We would also demonstrate practical Map Reduce programming examples with following Python modules. 
a) MRjob 
b) Hadoop Streaming

Audience will learn to develop scalable map-reduce programs to process data sets.
