### Michael Sparks

Sometimes you're asked to deliver the impossible in a given timeframe. Sometimes it's several seemingly impossible things. This talk covers a project like that, which has python involved at all layers - from microcontroller, through a Django website, through to a QT (PySide) client side application, resulting in a python programmable child friendly device. It'll be a brief overview of the various parts involved, including the python to C++ compiler developed over a period of 3-4 weeks.
