### Alex Willmer

Passwords are a pain for us all - programmers, users and admins alike. How can we reduce that pain, or eliminate it entirely?

This talk will 
 - Introduce the new standards Universal Authentication Framework (UAF) & Universal Second Factor (U2F)
 - Describe how they streamline authentication, even eliminate passwords entirely
 - Show how to integrate UAF/U2F into a Django web application
 - Summarize the state of support for UAF & U2F in browsers, devices, and the wider world

As an audience member you will
 - Learn how to implement seamless authentication
 - Gain a sense of hope, that you never have type EH3EX?e)8>6%sZ)48B^l3o08R again
