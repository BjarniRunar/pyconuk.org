### Edd Barrett

Language composition allows us to write programs in a mixture of different languages. This sounds ideal since it should allow us to choose the best mix of languages for the task at hand. Due to technical hurdles however, language compositions tend to be little more than simple foreign function interfaces (FFIs).
                                                                                
At King's college London we are trying to build better language compositions. We have devised a new approach which makes it much easier to intermingle programming languages without compromising performance. In this talk I will outline our approach and show what happens when you put Python and PHP in a blender.
