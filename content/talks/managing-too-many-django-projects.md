### Andrew Robinson

How can a small team of half a dozen people economically maintain a much larger number of projects?  

All the literature on software project management assumes that you have more developers than projects. We have been building bespoke solutions for many of our clients for ten years now, perhaps creating half a dozen new ones each year, and needing to make seemingly-minor changes to old ones all the time, with a team of around six.   
Code rapidly gets versions behind, developers move on and new ones join, and pretty soon every project ends up using different patterns and different versions of different libraries.   Clients don't want to pay for bringing things up to date, when all they want is a minor change; yet developers can't constantly switch in and out of different environments.  Sooner or later, it gets so bad that sysadmins shout and/or developers' brains explode, leaving a yucky mess everywhere.    This talk will explore the syndrome from both technical and management viewpoints, and explain a pattern we stumbled on that actually seems to be working rather well.
