### Tom Viner

The first half will look at how Python interacts with keyboard and command line *input*
- Reading standard input and command line arguments
- The built-in fileinput module: "Iterate over lines from multiple input streams", from pipe or via filename like GNU utils `cat` or `diff` do
- Reading keys in non-blocking mode: ascii one-d snake!

Then we'll look at the powers of Python in printing *output* to the screen
- Terminal colours
- The legacy of teleprinter output: overcoming the printed page metaphor
- Control characters: magic manipulation of the console

And we'll see various library modules that can help us along the way.
