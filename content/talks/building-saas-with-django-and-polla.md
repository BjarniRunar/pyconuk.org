### Emmanuelle Delescolle

Airavata is a tool to help run multiple websites under Django using the same codebase and the same database.
This talk will demonstrate how to build a SAAS service with those tools.

In the meantime you can already checkout [the project's page](https://bitbucket.org/levit_scs/airavata).
