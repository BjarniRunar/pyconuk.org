### Nicholas Tollervey

"This is my pet project. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

My drogulus, without me, is useless. Without my drogulus, I am useless. I must program my drogulus true. I must code straighter than my enemy who is trying to assimilate, measure and productise me. I must decentralise my enemy before my enemy sells me to the highest bidder".

The drogulus is my crazy philosophical thought experiment written in Python. I will describe and demonstrate it. You will all have a good laugh at my expense.

Please ensure there are doctors on hand to carry me away in a straight jacket when I've finished.
