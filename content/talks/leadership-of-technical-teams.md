### Owen Campbell

Over the years, I've led, and been a member of, numerous technical teams on a wide variety of projects. Based on that experience, this talk will describe my observations on the role of the leader in that sort of team.

The talk will be broken into 4 sections:

* Authority - Where it comes from and the challenges you might face depending on the answer.
* Priorities - What should you be focussing upon?
* Process - What's your role in defining and managing process?
* Style - There are many leadership styles, but what's yours and what's appropriate for technical teams?
