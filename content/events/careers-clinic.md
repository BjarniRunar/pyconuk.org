### Tony Camps

Tony will provide a statistical analysis of the last 12 months of hiring done in the UK Python sector including:

 * A breakdown of technical skill-sets in demand by industry and geography
 * An assessment of likely trends for the next 12 months (hint: functional programming is here to stay!).

Additionally, we'll discuss key information on what the industry requires of you:

 * What does it actually take to secure a job you will love in the Python sector?
 * Aside from being a good programmer â€“ what skills do you need to be able to demonstrate?

The session will be followed at 12:30 by a CV clinic, where Tony will provide expert insight in to how potential employers view your CV, and how to maximise your chances of getting your foot in the door.
