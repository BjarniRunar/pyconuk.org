### Eleonore Mayola

Python is widely used but can be limiting. When switching to functional programming, Clojure is quite close to Python. 
I'd like to share my journey of learning Clojure as a junior Pythonista. My best advice includes meeting the Clojure community, using online resources and getting the right tools to dive into a sea of parentheses! 
I think such an experience will help you write more concise code.
