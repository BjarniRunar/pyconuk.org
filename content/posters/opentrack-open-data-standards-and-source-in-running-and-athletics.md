### Andrew Robinson

The OpenTrack project aims to make both community running and the sport of athletics more enjoyable and easier to manage through open standards, open data and open source.   The first concrete goal is a hosted solution using mobile devices to let anybody put on an inter-club or inter-school race, with online entries, real-time recording of splits and results, and mobile-friendly results presentation.  The larger goal is to manage a complex system of clubs, teams, leaguse and federations through open data and cooperating web services.   

At the time of PyCon, we hope to know whether we we will have an EU technology grant to pursue this project seriously from October 1st.     We're inviting anyone with either a passion for running, or with experience of designing modern service-based platforms, to get involved at the outset.
