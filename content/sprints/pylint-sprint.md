### Claudiu Popa

This sprint session is aimed for anyone interested in static analysis or code quality for Python. We'll be working on Pylint, one of the most comprehensive static analysis tools, currently available in the Python world. This session will have a variety of issues for anyone to pick from, starting from bug fixes, feature requests or improving the documentation. If type inference, abstract interpretation, symbolic execution or type hinting makes you tick, then join and help us improving those things in Pylint.
