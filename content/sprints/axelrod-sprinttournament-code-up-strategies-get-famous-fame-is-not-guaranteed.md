### Vincent Knight

Following the talk on the Axelrod-Python library (http://www.pyconuk.org/talks/tit-for-tat-evolution-game-theory-and-the-python-axelrod-library/), this sprint will invite (and help) participants to submit new strategies to the library. This will not only help strengthen the library but should also be a fun exercise of creating a 'pyconuk 2015' tournament.

If you don't want to read the whole abstract for the Axelrod-Python talk here is the TL;DR: it's a tournament that was originally run in the 80s and asked participants to contribute strategies with which to play the prisoner's dilemma. This Python library is an open source version of it.
