### Fiona Burrows

Myrmidon is a multi-platform Python games framework. It's primary downsides are lack of documentation, testing and polish.

This sprint will be headed by three people whom are already very familiar with Myrmidon's workings.

The focus will be on:

* Teaching people how to use the framework for writing interactive games. Any confusing aspects of API or bugs will be flagged up for fixing.
* Writing documentation, using the previous point as a springboard for where we should focus documentation efforts.
* Getting more advanced developers up to speed with how the internals work and perhaps tackling some of the tasks on the issue tracker or improving performance.
