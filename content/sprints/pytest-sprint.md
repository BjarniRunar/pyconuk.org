### Floris Bruynooghe

A sprint on py.test and any of it's plugins.  Anything from a feature wanted or a bug you want fixed, we'll be glad to help you on the way.  If you do not have anything specific in mind then we'll have a list of (hopefully) easy tasks to help py.test along which you can get started on.
