### Open science sprint

Collaborative open science sprint where you can bring along a task to
automate, or a piece of code you want to open source, and we will help
you find others to form a small group to turn your existing scripts or
workflow into an reproducible piece of open science!

Good tasks to work on might include:

* figuring out whether Python is a good fit for your needs
* speeding-up your code
* writing developer or user documentation
* adding tests to legacy programs
* working out how to use [git](https://git-scm.com/) most effectively (other version control systems are available)
* packaging your software so that it can easily be installed


Our friends from [Overleaf](http://www.overleaf.com) will be joining us for this, they run a  collaborative cloud service for LaTeX users (think: Google docs for LaTeX) which has a very simple push-to-submit service for a number of Open Access journals and open science services, such as

* [F1000](http://f1000research.com/contact)
* [Figshare](http://figshare.com/)
* [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/)
* [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) and
* [Scientific Data](http://www.nature.com/sdata/).

This means that any software or figures you produce on the Monday Sprint can be given a DOI and easily shared with the scientific community.

Watch this space for more announcements - there <s>may even</s> **will** be prizes :)
