<h2>Call For Participation</h2>

<p>PyCon UK is a community conference, made by people like you!  All talks and
workshops are given by members of the community, and we'd like to invite
<strong>you</strong> to submit a proposal to present a talk or to run a
workshop.</p>

<p>To get an idea of topics that people have covered in the past, take a look at
<a href="http://pyconuk.net/Schedule">last year's schedule</a>. An skeleton of
this year's conference <a href="/schedule">already exists</a>.</p>

<p>You don't have to be a high-profile member of the community or a seasoned
speaker to submit a proposal.  In fact, we're particularly keen to hear from you
if this would be your first conference talk.  PyCon audiences are always
friendly and welcoming.</p>

<p>The Call For Participation for talks and workshops will close on June 19th, and we hope to announce
the programme by the beginning of July.  When selecting the programme, we will
aim to choose sessions that promise to be interesting and enjoyable, while
ensuring the line-up is as varied and balanced as possible.</p>

<h3>New - Poster Session at PyCon UK</h3>

<p>
This year we will be adding a poster session to PyCon UK. Poster sessions are great chances to present a topic with the aid of a poster, and to interact with small groups of people in a more informal and relaxed way than a formal talk.
</p>

<p>Posters will be accepted for the poster session on a rolling basis until 1 August or the limit of 20 posters is reached. And yes, talk proposals which are not accepted can be reworked and submitted as posters.
</p>

<p><b>For more information about the poster session</b>, visit the <a href="/posters/">poster session page</a>.

<p><b>Please note</b> that speakers, workshop leaders, and poster presenters are expected to buy tickets,
and that we are not able to provide financial assistance to speakers this
year.</p>

<p>So, if you'd like to submit a proposal for a talk, a workshop, or a poster please fill
out the form below.</p>
