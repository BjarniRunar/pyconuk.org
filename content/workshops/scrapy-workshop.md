If you want to get data from the web, and there are no APIs available, then you need to use web scraping! Scrapy is the most effective and popular choice for web scraping and is used in many areas such as data science, journalism, business intelligence, web development, etc.

This workshop will provide an overview of Scrapy, starting from the fundamentals and working through each new topic with hands-on examples.

Participants will come away with a good understanding of Scrapy, the principles behind its design, and how to apply the best practices encouraged by Scrapy to any scraping task.

Goals:

- Set up a python environment.
- Learn basic concepts of the Scrapy framework.
